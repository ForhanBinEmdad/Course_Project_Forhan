        "    'Hey Guys,  Its been 4 months since my last post as I wanted to give it a few months to see how this was going to work.  So, I have been on Trulicity for six months now with Metformin.  When I hit the five month period the diarrhea, gas, sulphur belching finally subsided.  I now longer have any of those side effects.  However, I still havent lost any weight at all, but I think that was because when I first started Trulicity I was taking it with Glimepiride and that one has a side effect of weight gain so I think the two meds were fighting each other lol.  I have been back on the Metformin with Trulicity for about a week now, so we will see what this does.  I was diagnosed as  stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD 3) so I am watching diet closely.'\n",
        "'I was recently referred to a endocrinologist and he started me on Trulicity and Jardiance. Ive tried to take Byetta in the past but had to stop because it made me very sick. I lost weight.

        "'Ive taken one dose of Trulicity and while I do have mild nausea it is not bad and I have switched from coffee to green tea in the morning. Really helps. That I would recommend. Sugar levels have not dropped significantly but they are dropping. Guess one week wont work wonders and I have to wait a bit. I dont know if it is the Trulicity or the Jardiance or the combo of both but I have managed to lose 7 pounds in 5 days.'\n",

That brought my levels down to an average of about 14 while fasting. Since being on the Victoza the highest reading I have had so far is a 12.5 which for me is incredible I cant wait to see what I will be at over the next month.  I am not focusing on the weight loss at the moment if it happens awesome, but Im most concerned about my sugars. As for side effects I have had very mild nausea and thats all.'\n",

I have a sandwich in my lunchbox, but I dont have any appetite. I havent had any of the side effects so far. I started with the 1.2 dose. The is really easy to use compared to my intramuscular testosterone. However, this drug is ridiculously expensive. Even with good insurance, I would have to pay almost $400 a MONTH!!! Fortunately, another serious illness pushed me over my out-of-pocket annual. So, I filled the script for $0. Due to politics I may have no insurance next year. Anyway, so far, so good with Victoza.'\n",

I was really happy with the medicine until the known side effects started to show. They were nausea this happened approx once a week in the fourth week in on taking the medicine and bloating, indigestion, a lot of passing wind and acidy burps. Also I felt a bump and itchy feeling around injection area whenever I injected. If they can sort out these side effects then it would be really fantastic for people with Type 2 diabetes. I was really reluctant to stop but the horrible nausea beat me.  '\n",

Injecting in fatty tissue of stomach hardly any pain. Very well designed device and needle almost painless. I would recommend this for T2s who have gone to max on oral meds and need that extra help, this really is the magic bullet for me. I can handle weekly injections but not daily thats too much imho.'\n",

My last a1c was so good last time, my doctor wants me to decrease to 5mcg. I have been to several dermatologists over the last 2 years trying to figure out why I am having hair loss, unhealthy hair, and change in texture. I never wanted to attribute it to the Byetta although the hair loss started a few months after I began taking it. I am now so desperate to stop the hair loss, Im considering stopping the Byetta. I cant decide which would be worse - being bald or gaining back 42 pounds! I would really love to know if the person who recently posted had any hair regrowth after stopping Byetta.'\n",

Vomiting, explosive diarrhea, gas pains and bloating like never before, long flatulence every few minutes (how embarrassing!), and sulfur-tasting belching (like rotten eggs).  Endo dr. said it wasnt the med.  I went to my primary doctor because I wasnt sure if it was a virus.  All of my tests came back negative.  Third week, same thing.  I decided not to take the injection and notified endo. She told me to stop metformin and resume shot.  Last week, had shot and condition worsened.  She finally told me to stop the injections.  Its been four weeks of suffering.  Not worth it!  This stuff is poison to me!'\n",

I noticed after about 3 months the effects wore off so my doctor put me on 1.5mg 1x per week plus the .75mg 1x per week. None of the side effects returned...my appetite is back, no queasiness, weight loss stopped as well as no more sour stomach or belching. Wonder if anyone else has experienced the effects of the medicine wearing off as well. Not sure why I am still on it at this point! Also taking 1000mg Metformin 2x daily &amp; invokanna.'\n",

In March my Dr started me on Januvia also and I cant believe the difference.  My A1C went from 9.4 to 7.0 in 4 months.  I am also surprised I havent had any side effects because it seems many meds bother me.  My problem now is my new health insurance wont cover Januvia as of Jan 2016.  Yuck.'\n",

        "'Bydureon helped me get my A1c numbers down. If I would just follow the rules and eat right, it could do wonders. Also, for those getting the nodules at the injection site, put an ice pack on the site for about 15 minutes and you will probably not get a knot. Works wonders for me.'\n",

The biggest things to get used to were the nausea and the diarrhea but after giving 4 weeks to adjust to the medication my blood sugar does not spike like it used to and I felt better.  I dont have my usual cravings for anything bad for me  but I do have an appetite.  I tell anyone who needs to lose a few pounds and lower blood sugar to stick with it.  It will get better.  I cant complain about the medication.  All anti-diabetic agents cause the stomach issues.  Hang in there.'\n",

Its been crazy and am looking at changing to something different now :/'\n",

I have excellent blood pressure, on the lower end of normal, and this dropped it down to the point I could barely function. Fatigue so bad I had to stop driving after 15 miles because I was falling asleep at the wheel. Going up the 3 flights of stairs to my apt felt like climbing Mt. Everest. Constant dizziness, wooziness, the floor felt like it was moving when Id bend down. Weird tunnel vision effect like what happens when you know youre gonna faint. It took 2 full days for all those side effects to clear after I quit taking it. I suffered 12 days thinking Id get used to it but it just kept getting worse. Beware low BP side effects with it'\n",

They found I was insulin resistance. So, they put me on Actos  for about  6 months and that is what got everything under control. I also had a extreme diet change  in 4 months I lost 100 lbs. Also helped my numbers. Unfortunately I had a life changing event which required me too move out of state.

The nausea was quick and unexpected and I wanted to throw in the towel. Im now on week 6 and feel fine most of the time. The fatigue is still there sometimes but its been manageable. This has been the best medicine for me by far. I  am on the low dose .75 and also take metformin 500 mg twice daily. I find the best time to take my shot is at night before I go to bed and I only take 1- 500 mg of metformin the day after the shot, where the side effects were more active.

I have been very careful not to eat greasy foods, but have found that if I do eat something I feel badly for only  a bit. My sugar count daily was never under 180 always between 230 and 300. I was disgusted even to take it. No matter if I ate salads or a cheeseburger it was high. I woke up this morning and my count was 120. I feel good but I am a little sleepy. Taking the shot is so easy, last time I had to check and make sure there was a puncture mark because I didnt feel the needle.

Also, Im not seeing a huge improvement on my daily numbers - its been 4 hours since breakfast and my blood glucose is 172.

I changed doctors and my new doctor recommended Victoza again.  This time without using Metformin or any other diabetes medication. Reluctantly, I tried it and to my surprise,  I have had great results.  I no longer have cravings for sweets and my appetite has changed drastically. I have zero side effects.

What I have realized is that this medicine actually makes your stomach empty slower into the smaller intestine.  Imagine you have a chemically induced lap-band.  You cannot eat what you were use to, your stomach is half full to begin with.  So with alot of trial and error you will figure out the eating habits to prevent the reflux and such.

When I hit the five month period the diarrhea, gas, sulphur belching finally subsided.  I now longer have any of those side effects.  However, I still havent lost any weight at all, but I think that was because when I first started Trulicity I was taking it with Glimepiride and that one has a side effect of weight gain so I think the two meds were fighting each other lol.  I have been back on the Metformin with Trulicity for about a week now, so we will see what this does.  I was diagnosed as  stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD 3) so I am watching diet closely.'\n",

Since being on the Victoza the highest reading I have had so far is a 12.5 which for me is incredible I cant wait to see what I will be at over the next month.

They were nausea this happened approx once a week in the fourth week in on taking the medicine and bloating, indigestion, a lot of passing wind and acidy burps.

I have been to several dermatologists over the last 2 years trying to figure out why I am having hair loss, unhealthy hair, and change in texture. I never wanted to attribute it to the Byetta although the hair loss started a few months after I began taking it. I am now so desperate to stop the hair loss, Im considering stopping the Byetta.

Endo dr. said it wasnt the med.  I went to my primary doctor because I wasnt sure if it was a virus.  All of my tests came back negative.  Third week, same thing.  I decided not to take the injection and notified endo. She told me to stop metformin and resume shot.  Last week, had shot and condition worsened.  She finally told me to stop the injections.
